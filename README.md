# Hurdle Frontend 
The Hurdle Frontend Server is responsible for rendering the user interface (UI). The frontend of a website encompasses everything that the user sees and interacts with - from the keys on the visual keyboard that users can click on, to the colors of each letter in their submitted guess.

See the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cpsc121-s23-hurdle" target="_blank">Hurdle Project Spec</a> for detailed instructions on the Hurdle Frontend Server implementation, the API that enables the Hurdle frontend and backend to communicate, and an overview of how the data sent from the server is parsed on the frontend to update the UI.
